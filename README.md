# consolegame
Repo for the console game.

This is where we will upload the source code for our game with all its features and some documents.

All work will be done in a feature branch and never on the main or dev branches. 

When you are done with a feature make a merge request and it will be reviewed by another dev.

If the feature passes review it will be merged with the dev branch.

The same goes for bugfix branches and other branches.
